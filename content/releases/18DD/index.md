---Since before Ben or Charlie were part of the band, 18 Daydreams has been in the works. The chromatic riff the song is based around has made its way into many unsuccessful songwriting efforts over time.

<h4>Structure</h4>
The verse was created to be driving and upbeat, with a taste of grunge and rock. The chorus is a stark contrast in halftime, giving the listener an auditory intermission from the energetic verse. The outro compliments the song as a whole, combining the grunge of the verse and the halftime of the chorus.

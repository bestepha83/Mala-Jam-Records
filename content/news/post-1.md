When you have time on your hands, you can focus on your passions: that's what Jack and Henry did.

Inspired by many of the great music producers of their generation, Mala Jam hopes to start with a strong foot forward. What we see as being a common thread between the best record labels and music producers is not caring about too much. In the end, it's all about making music for our friends to listen to. Our current sound of teenage music.

With that in mind, we don't stop there. We at Mala Jam and those we work with create a wonderful web that spans beyond just music and into a beautiful world of strategy, technology and visual artistry.

Mala Jam is working on a lot. Jack and Henry are both currently producing many records, each unique in all aspects. Projects connected to Mala Jam are firing at all cylinders creating wonderful content showcasing artists. Lastly, our community is working on designing the website and creating content for our artists.

---<h4>The Beginning</h4>

While students at Kaleidoscope Middle School, Jando, Jack, and Henry met and became friends while sharing their interest in music and the arts. This shared interest blossomed into a jazz combo, The Minus One Quartet. As they matured, their music transformed to serve the three of them. The rock band Specific Ocean was the first iteration of their creative journey. The group learned and grew together musically throughout their first two years of high school, playing with an abundance of temporary members.

<h4>Development</h4>

Their Junior year, the trio decided to take their music in a more serious direction. Re-branding, they changed their name to Goodbye Eden and auditioned lead guitar players. Goodbye Eden soon accepted Ben Stephan as their first new permanent member. Throughout their Junior and Senior years, GBE began learning more covers and playing at high school house parties around the community. In their final performance as high schoolers, GBE wanted to foster a sense of community with their music. They performed Che Che Cole, a song requiring lots of instruments, the most important being a piano player. This led to their last permanent member to join the group: Charlie Monroe.

<h4>The Turning Point</h4>

Before the band dispersed to their separate colleges, they hit a songwriting streak, writing and recording an EP in merely two weeks. At the same time, they prepared for what they thought would be their last performance together, the Goodbye, Goodbye Eden concert. The band soon realized their passion for writing and the potential of their new songs. In December of 2019, the band went to work writing and recording a full album of new tunes.

<h4>Now</h4>

The band is currently working on their second album and focusing on discovering the true sound of Goodbye Eden.

A New York City-based singer/songwriter, Susie McCollum's style is not quite folk and not quite pop. Her style is unique, and that's how she likes it.

Blending her playful yet mature view of the world through poetry and a powerful voice,her music speaks to the intricacies of relationships and the complexity of the human experience.

Beginning to write music in the 9th grade, taking inspiration from trailblazers like Nina Simone, Anna Nalick, and Joni Mitchell, Susie quickly found her sound. She is a graduate of Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School and is pursuing a Theater and International Studies degree at Northwestern University.

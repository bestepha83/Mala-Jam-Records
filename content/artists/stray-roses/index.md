Stray Roses is an artistic power duo based in LA, whose sound is a touching combination of mainly indie/alternative, but definitely one of its own.

Through their tunes, Stray Roses gives their listeners a glimpse of a new perspective of what we call life. Whether itâ€™s an energetic lament or a relaxing lullaby, they hope to provide raw stories with good vibrations.

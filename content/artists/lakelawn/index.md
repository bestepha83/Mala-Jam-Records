Lakelawn is a rock band from Madison, Wisconsin. A collaboration between Jazz students and local musicians, Lakelawn crafts tasteful melodies and original sounds from a diverse range of influences.

At the beginning of 2020 they began playing shows at local taverns including the Der Rathskellar in the Wisconsin Union. Currently they are collaborating remotely across the Midwest.
